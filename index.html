        <h2>A New Relationship With Nature</h2>
        <p>Think of entering a garden that greets you. Literally. In this future, nature is not a background, nature is an interface. Using biofeedback and emotional Artificial Intelligence, each plant reads your inner emotional state and reacts. Welcome to the Future Garden, a place where you do not only take care of plants… they take care of you in turn.</p>

        <h2>Plants That Sense You</h2>
        <p>Micro-sensors embedded beneath the soil monitor your bio-signal such as pulse, temperature, even brain waves. The plants change subtly as you get closer: leaves open wider in excitement, or shut a little if your heart starts racing. This is beyond beauty, it's emotional language between species.</p>

        <h2>Responsive Color and Sound</h2>
        <p>Biotech-created flowers present actual-time visible feedback. Being happy, petals are bright; being sad, they darken in deep colors. Certain plants will make low sounds to match your heart rate, giving the plant a soundtrack that reflects exactly your mood at that very moment.</p>

        <h2>Self-Regulating Microclimates</h2>
        <p>The garden follows your physical conditioning. Too hot? Plants are arched over you with shading. Too tired? The plants gets lighter up to a point where you are led to a zone of rest. This intelligent landscape employs data on your senses and makes you feel safe, balanced and observed.</p>
